//! Microbenchmarks for the decode and encode paths, run as `zig build bench`.
//!
//! In-process rather than hparse's subprocess-per-implementation shape: there
//! is nothing to compare against yet. When there is — nghttp2's HPACK is the
//! obvious first — it arrives as hparse does it, a C binary under `bench/`
//! compiled by Zig's bundled clang, outside `src/` and outside the lint's
//! walk. The reporting table below is already the shape that comparison wants.
//!
//! Two footguns this harness exists to have gotten right once, both learned in
//! hparse:
//!
//! 1. **ReleaseFast is hardcoded**, not offered. `standardOptimizeOption`'s
//!    `preferred_optimize_mode` does *not* do this — it still yields Debug
//!    unless `-Drelease` is passed, which produces numbers that mean nothing.
//! 2. **`use_llvm` is set** in build.zig. Zig 0.16's self-hosted x86_64 backend
//!    scalarizes `@Vector` code, and HPACK's Huffman decode is exactly the kind
//!    of table-and-vector work that would silently lose an order of magnitude.
//!
//! Read the numbers as bands across runs, never as single values. `min` is the
//! least noisy signal on a laptop; `mean` and `max` say how much the machine
//! was interfering while it was collected.
