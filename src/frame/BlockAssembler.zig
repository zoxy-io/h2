//! RFC 9113 section 4.3: reassembling a field block from the frames it spans.
//!
//! A field section arrives as either one HEADERS or PUSH_PROMISE frame with
//! END_HEADERS set, or one without it followed by CONTINUATION frames, the last
//! of which sets it. The sequence must be contiguous — "no interleaved frames
//! of any other type or from any other stream" — and a CONTINUATION must follow
//! a frame that left the block open. Those are framing rules, decidable from
//! the frames alone, so they live here.
//!
//! This is the first thing in the package that holds state between calls.
//! Everything else is a pure function over borrowed octets, and it stays that
//! way where it can; a field block simply is not a property of one frame.
//!
//! ## What the caller owns
//!
//! The buffer, and the frame bound. The buffer is where fragments are
//! assembled, and its length *is* the octet bound — the same arrangement
//! HPACK's decoder uses, where the caller's output buffer is what a compression
//! bomb runs into. The frame bound is a separate parameter because it cannot be
//! derived from the octet one.
//!
//! The buffer is reused from offset zero by every block, so a completed
//! `Block.fragment` is valid only until the next frame lands one. Decode it
//! before offering the next frame. The frame bound is per block, not per
//! connection: how many blocks a peer may open is a question about streams, and
//! `SETTINGS_MAX_CONCURRENT_STREAMS` is where the caller answers it.
//!
//! That last point is the whole shape of the CONTINUATION flood, and it is
//! worth being explicit about. HPACK's decoder needs no field-count bound: every
//! field costs at least 32 octets against the size bound, so a count bound
//! follows from it. A CONTINUATION frame can carry an *empty* fragment. A peer
//! can therefore send them forever, accumulating zero octets, and an octet
//! bound alone never fires. The two bounds are independent because one of them
//! can be spent without spending the other.
//!
//! ## Two kinds of failure
//!
//! Sequencing violations are the peer breaking RFC 9113, and section 4.3 makes
//! them connection errors of type PROTOCOL_ERROR. Exceeding a bound is the peer
//! staying inside the rules and being expensive anyway, which is what
//! ENHANCE_YOUR_CALM exists for (section 7: "the endpoint detected that its
//! peer is exhibiting a behavior that might be generating excessive load").
//! Reporting both as PROTOCOL_ERROR would tell a peer it is malformed when it
//! is merely unwelcome.
