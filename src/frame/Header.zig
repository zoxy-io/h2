//! RFC 9113 section 4.1: the nine octets every frame begins with.
//!
//!     +-----------------------------------------------+
//!     |                 Length (24)                   |
//!     +---------------+---------------+---------------+

//!     +=+=============================================================+
//!
//! ## What a header can decide on its own
//!
//! More than it looks. Whether a frame's length is legal for its type, and
//! whether its stream identifier is, are both answerable from these nine octets
//! — no payload needed — and between them they are most of what RFC 9113 calls
//! a connection error. `validate` answers both.
//!
//! What it cannot answer is anything inside the payload: whether a pad length
//! fits, whether a `WINDOW_UPDATE` increment is non-zero, whether a promised
//! stream identifier is even. Those belong to the payload codec.
//!
//! ## Unknown types are a rule, not a gap
//!
//! Section 4.1 requires an unimplemented frame type to be *ignored* — skipped by
//! its declared length — rather than rejected. `Type` is therefore a
//! non-exhaustive enum, so a consumer's `switch` has to say what it does with
//! one, and `validate` imposes no length or stream rule on a type it does not
//! know. An extension frame arriving mid-connection is ordinary traffic.
//!
//! ## Flags are per-type
//!
//! The same bit means different things to different types: `0x01` is END_STREAM
//! on DATA and ACK on SETTINGS. Reading a flag therefore goes through `has`,
//! which asserts the flag is one the type defines, so asking a DATA frame
//! whether it is an ACK is a programming error rather than a wrong answer.
//! Undefined flags are ignored on receipt, as section 4.1 requires.
