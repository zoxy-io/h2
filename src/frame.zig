//! HTTP/2 framing (RFC 9113 sections 4 to 6).

//! Framing only: no connection state machine, no stream table, and no policy
//! about which frames a peer ought to send. What belongs here is what the
//! octets themselves decide — a length that contradicts its type, a stream
//! identifier a type forbids, a padding length that does not fit. Whether to
//! refuse a `PUSH_PROMISE` or advertise `SETTINGS_ENABLE_PUSH = 0` is a
//! consumer's decision, and this package has two consumers who would answer
//! differently.
