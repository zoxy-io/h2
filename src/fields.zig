//! RFC 9113 section 8.2: what a field name and value may contain, and section
//! 8.3: which pseudo-header fields may appear where.
//!
//! This is not framing and it is not HPACK, which is why it is a third module
//! rather than a corner of one of the other two. HPACK will carry any octets at
//! all — that is its job — and the frame codec sees a field block as an opaque
//! run. The rules that make a *message* well-formed sit between them, and this
//! is where.
//!
//! ## Checks, not enforcement
//!
//! Everything here answers a question and refuses nothing. Whether a malformed
//! field ends a stream, gets logged, or is deliberately sent anyway is a
//! consumer's decision, and this package has two consumers who answer
//! differently: zoxy refuses, and zrk is a load generator that may want to send
//! something malformed to find out what a server does with it. The check itself
//! is RFC text and is identical for both, so this package owns the check and
//! neither consumer owns a copy of it.
//!
//! That is the same boundary the frame codec draws for `PUSH_PROMISE`: parse
//! and render, and say nothing about who should refuse what.
//!
//! ## Two shapes, because there are two kinds of question
//!
//! `validateName` and `validateValue` are pure functions of one string, and a
//! consumer can call either on its own. `MessageValidator` is fed a whole field
//! block one field at a time, because section 8.3's rules are about position
//! and repetition and so need to remember what came before.
