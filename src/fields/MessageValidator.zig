//! RFC 9113 section 8.3: which pseudo-header fields may appear, where, and how
//! many times — and section 8.2.2's connection-specific fields.
//!
//! Where `syntax.zig` asks whether a string is a legal field name, this asks
//! whether a *message* is well-formed. Those are different questions with
//! different shapes: the first is a pure function of one string, and this one
//! needs to remember what it has already seen.
//!
//! ## Fed one field at a time, on purpose
//!
//! The decoder is an iterator, and the fields it emits borrow from a buffer the
//! caller is free to reuse on the next step. A validator taking a `[]const
//! Field` would force a consumer to materialize a whole block first, which is
//! the allocation this package spends its design on avoiding.
//!
//! So nothing here retains a slice across a call. Where a later rule depends on
//! an earlier field's *value* — whether the method was CONNECT, whether the
//! scheme was http-like, whether the path was empty — the bit is computed while
//! the field is in hand and only the bit is kept. That is the same lifetime
//! rule `Field` states, enforced rather than restated.
//!
//! ## What is checked here and what is not
//!
//! Checked: every rule in section 8.3 that the field block decides on its own —
//! that pseudo-header fields are defined, are the ones defined for this
//! direction, precede every regular field, do not repeat, and that the
//! mandatory ones are present; section 8.5's restrictions on CONNECT; and
//! section 8.2.2's connection-specific fields, which is where a
//! `transfer-encoding` smuggled through an HTTP/1.1 downgrade would be caught.
//!
//! Not checked, because none of it is decidable from a field block alone:
//! whether `:authority` and a `Host` header identify the same entity (section
//! 8.3.1 wants both normalized as URIs), whether `:authority` carries the
//! deprecated userinfo subcomponent, whether a `content-length` matches the
//! DATA frames that follow it (section 8.1.1), and whether a method or status
//! is one that exists. The first two want a URI parser and the last two want
//! connection state; both belong to a consumer.
//!
//! ## Malformed is always the same answer
//!
//! Section 8.1.1: every violation here is "a stream error (Section 5.4.2) of
//! type PROTOCOL_ERROR". There is deliberately no `errorCode` or `severity`
//! function to go with these errors, unlike `frame.Header`, because there is
//! nothing for one to decide — the errors are distinguished so a consumer can
//! log which rule broke, not so it can answer the peer differently.
