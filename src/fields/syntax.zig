//! RFC 9113 section 8.2.1: which octets may appear in a field name and value.
//!
//! This is the h2-to-h1 downgrade guard. A value carrying CR or LF that reaches
//! an HTTP/1.1 upstream is a request-splitting primitive, and section 8.2.1 is
//! written the way it is because of it. The rules are short enough to read in
//! full:
//!
//! * a field name MUST NOT contain 0x00-0x20, 0x41-0x5a, or 0x7f-0xff;
//! * a field name MUST NOT contain a colon, except as the single leading octet
//!   of a pseudo-header field;
//! * a field value MUST NOT contain NUL, LF or CR at any position;
//! * a field value MUST NOT start or end with SP or HTAB.
//!
//! ## Two readings, and why both ship
//!
//! Section 8.2.1 states two levels and means both. It *recommends* validating
//! against RFC 9110 sections 5.1 and 5.5 — `field-name = token`, and a field
//! value of visible characters with interior whitespace — and then *requires*
//! the four bullets above as a floor. The recommended reading rejects sixteen
//! octets the floor admits:
//!
//!     " ( ) , / ; < = > ? @ [ \ ] { }
//!
//! That is RFC 9110 section 5.6.2's delimiter set with the colon removed. The
//! colon is its seventeenth member, and it is not in this list because the
//! floor already refuses it everywhere except a pseudo-header's first octet —
//! so it is not a place the two readings differ.
//!
//! `Rules.strict` is the recommendation and `Rules.minimal` is the floor.
//! Neither is this package's decision to make: a proxy hardening a downgrade
//! wants `strict`, and a load generator replaying a capture wants to know
//! whether a peer would call the capture malformed at all. What this package
//! owns is that the two readings are stated once, from the RFC text, rather
//! than transcribed into each consumer with a different set of typos.
//!
//! `strict` rejects a superset of what `minimal` rejects — asserted at compile
//! time below, over all 256 octets, because a "stricter" mode that accepts
//! something the looser one refuses would be a silent hole rather than a
//! stricter mode.
//!
//! ## One deviation, stated where it happens
//!
//! An empty name is rejected under both. The four bullets are character rules
//! and say nothing about length, so the floor as literally written admits it;
//! but the definition section 8.2.1 points at is `field-name = token = 1*tchar`,
//! which does not, and a nameless field rendered into HTTP/1.1 is a bare
//! `: value` line. It is refused here rather than left to a consumer that would
//! have to remember.
//!
//! ## Why this is where the vectors are
//!
//! Byte classification over a contiguous run is the one shape in this package
//! that vectorizes. Huffman decoding is a bit-serial chain of dependent loads
//! and does not, which is why #1's design comment calls "vectorized HPACK" a
//! category error. Here every octet is independent of every other, so the
//! kernel is a handful of range compares per 16 or 32 octets, and the names
//! and values the decoder hands over are already in cache.
